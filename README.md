You know whatâ€™s missing? An easy tool that just installs capibilities (ArgoCD, Datadog, KubeVirt, etc.) in an easy way. One command to do it all.

A tool that easily gets whatever capabilities you want your kubernetes cluster to have deployed in production.

`capipe`, which stands for Capibility Platform Engineering, allows you to specify capabilities that you want to install within your Platform Engineering environment.

## Why?

The two biggest questions I get are:
1. What tools should I use?
2. How can I easily deploy a production environment?

Those questions are why I made CapiPE.

Easily deploy what you need in a Kubernetes cluster with one command.

## Dependencies

1. Helm

## Install

Before an actual version is built and released, you can build the CLI/binary/artifact by running the following command in the directory/repo.

```
go build
```

## Command Examples

Add a GitOps Controller

```
capipe argocd
```

```
capipe flux
```

Use flags
```
./capipe datadog --apikey "" --clustername ""
```
